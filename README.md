A fun project i did drawing an anime character naruto
In this project, I have used Python turtle graphics to draw Naruto, a popular anime character from the Naruto series. Turtle graphics is a module in Python that allows you to create pictures and animations with a virtual turtle that moves on a screen. You can control the turtle’s position, direction, color, and pen size by writing Python code.

To draw Naruto, I have divided his face and body into different parts, such as his eyes, nose, mouth, hair, headband, clothes, etc. For each part, I have defined a function that draws the shape and color of that part using the turtle module’s methods and attributes. For example, to draw Naruto’s eyes, I have used the circle() method to draw the iris and pupil, the dot() method to draw the highlight, and the fillcolor() and begin_fill() attributes to fill the eye with color.

I have also used loops and recursion to create complex patterns and designs. For example, to draw Naruto’s hair, I have used a loop to repeat the same commands for each strand of hair. To draw his headband, I have used recursion to draw a fractal pattern that resembles the leaf symbol of his village.

By combining these functions and commands, I have created a realistic and colorful drawing of Naruto using Python turtle graphics. This project demonstrates my knowledge of Python programming, turtle graphics, geometry, and art.
